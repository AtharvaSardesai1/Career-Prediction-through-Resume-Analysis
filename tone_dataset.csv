it is a very nice tea with rather strong pu-erh flavor  price is reasonable as well  quick processing  this is my second order  if nothing changes with the seller product  i will order again ,formal
stale and greasy six months prior to expiration   it did not look greasy but it coated my tongue with a greasy film    i should have asked for a refund but did not attempt this   garbage item ,formal
three matzo balls per can  only three  lots of broth though  not as good as homemade  of course  but perfect for when you are at work and need a little comfort the cans are nice for transport  will not break in your bag,formal
packing was not appropriate  the cardboard box was torn in several places  cans were dented  one can had broken and leaked over at least 4 other cans causing a smelly mess  it was quite unpleasant ,formal
if you like white cheddar popcorn  you may love this transformation of it into an easy to eat chip that is low in fat and sodium  only 130 calories per serving  it is a great snack for parties and healthier than potato chips ,formal

our toddler loves these puffs  all the flavors  great to pack on the go   not many calories per serving but its better than nothing if the baby wants to take nothing else ,formal
i had purchased this for my family  a little overpriced but i would purchase again   it is just a tad sweet with only 100 calories per bottle   my son takes these with his lunch for school ,formal
this product was delivered on time  but i can not say that it was worth the money   when you look at the price per oz  it becomes much more expensive than you think ,formal
it is flavored water   not much to review as far as the product itself   one would not buy it if they didnt like the taste   better price than buying in convenience store   very fast delivery ,formal
he takes his mini bone into another room and eats it facing away from us  we believe he does this in order to hide it and be sure we will not take it away ,formal
the product was just as stated \ the wonderful cheesey taste that only kraft mac and cheese has \ only now it can be shaken onto anything \ popcorn was a given but when i sprinkled it on to my no sauce meatballs i was hooked ,formal
this is my favorite adult cereal - low in sugar and fats  high on crunch  flavor  and fiber   recommend that parents start their kids on this cereal instead of the sugar-coated cereals ,formal

my doggy loves these treats  but cannot find them any longer in the pet store i usually shop in this type of container   these were rather expensive for the size compared to the ones i bought at the pet store ,formal

the honey is great but upon weighing the contents their is only 15 5 ounces of honey and not 16  not a huge deal but lies none the less  amazon owes me 3 ounces of honey for the case i just ordered,formal
thanks quaker for shorting all the boxes now to 8 count and charging the same price per box   so a 20% price hike amazon  uh you might want to change the picture from the 10 count box ,formal

the coffee is good  but i have been trying to cancel the auto shipments but its impossible to find any way for customer service to help  therefore they continue sending it and i have to keep sending it back ,formal
i discovered these biscuits in the states some years ago - upon returning i found only winn dixies the store to sell them - unlike the traditional italian homedae puff pastry ones they are just as tasty   not too sweet and lovely with cheese,formal
i will be re-ordering   great mix of flavors and only 3 pts a bag for weight watcher points   also there are 65 fries per 1 oz bag   nice to have something different to choose from ,formal
i have purchased these fries before---both in this flavor and the other flavors available   they are great tasting and only have 110 calories per bag   i would highly recommend this product to anyone ,formal
these kashi bars are some of the very few you can buy that are not coated in chocolate   they are chewy and take longer to eat therefore making them satisfying   they are loaded with protein  fiber and not too much sugar ,formal
this product is absolutely perfect for me  make sure to drink at least an eight ounce glass of water with this bar  the taste is like a candy bar and it is as filling as a meal  i love it ,formal
my 4 shelties love the nb beef  i use it for clicker training; mixed with cheerios or pea size bits for a high value treat but low calorie   smells great  makes you want to lick your hands too ,formal

a very good blend of iced tea and lemonade   for those of you who enjoy an arnold palmer in the warmer months  this is pertfect for you  add lots of ice and brew in the 8 oz  or 10 os  settings ,formal
this tastes extremely similar  if note exactly the same  as the regular version of celestial seasonings india spice chai tea  which has caffeine in it  delicious i bought it in bulk  and am enjoying 1-3 cups per day ,formal
the flavor is great  it is not packed with too much water  it is not too salty  and i can not beat the price per ounce even when the smaller cans are on sale  it freezes easily ,formal
this is a very good chilli mix for cincinnati style chilli   it reminds me of the great chilli parlors when i lived there  yummy recommend you serve it over spaghetti  topped with kidney beans  green onions and sharp cheddar cheese ,formal
total bummer because these cookies truly are delicious   just bought a box at trader joe is  ate one cookie with my tea  loved it  then i read the trans fat content  1g per cookie   so i had to throw them away,formal
i find the crisps dissolve in your mouth and are not especially filling   it is pretty tasty and an unbelievable 40 calories per pack   but i think i will stick to regular apples as more filling and tastier ,formal
not my cup of tea  or coffee ; but my wife enjoys flavored coffees and this is her favorite  i do admit to enjoying the aroma  but give me regular flavored coffee anytime  also  the price per cup can not be beat ,formal
this is a great product  great value   i take bottles per day  it gives me a nice boost of energy   like to take it first thing in the morning and at 3pm or after lunch   great taste ,formal
tea is rather bland but my main disappointment is that it hardly has a vanilla flavour  package mentions carob and natural flavour  not organic i assume   do not know if the carob overpowers the flavour and give a rather strange flavour   ,formal
this is coffee in a pod  so one can not compare it with fresh-ground coffee   however  for a pod it is very tasty   sustainability is just as important as convenience  so this wolfgang puck fair-trade organic pod is a great option ,formal
i find equal yellow as good or better than splenda yellow and buying it on amazon on a scheduled basis gives a lower cost than the store  therefore i rank equal yellow above the splenda version  it is not just equal,formal
these were recommended by my vet   they break apart pretty easily for my small dogs while the big dogs get a whole bone   it is the enzymes that help the teeth   wish they were less expensive however  ,formal
have not come across this product in any store and find it very good  my dogs like it and would only have one comment to make it smaller for small dogs instead of one size fits all,formal
there is something so fantastic about a giant marshmallow on top of a cookie and covered in chocolate  each one is pretty big and fluffy  but be warned you get about 18 per package and they go quick you really need self control with these,formal
just the product i have been searching for years for at local grocery stores   i will make my food purchases through online and screw the brick and mortar stores for refusing to stock the items the public really wants to buy ,formal
i was trying to drink more green tea but found most to be rather tasteless  then i tried the green chai tea and i love it  it has a richer taste with all the various spices it has blended with the green tea ,formal
i like it - it is fairly light compared to some i tried   i did notice that you can get it from giant foods supermarkets  mid atlantic chain  for 3 clams per box if you want to try it before ordering so many ,formal
this is yummy coffee but does not taste like pumpkin per se  just a sweeter blend really  i do not think it is worth the money if pumpkin spice is what you are after,formal
i bought these for the kids to eat whilst on their summer vacation   they are ideal for putting in lunch boxes and taking along as snacks   ideal for playdates too as the chocolate in the chips is not messy ,formal
my standard of reference for canned espresso is  starbucks doubleshot espresso drink  12 - 6 5 oz  cans  and this espresso does not have the bite of doubleshot  but it has only 50 calories  so you compromise flavour for low calories ,formal
this is about the quickest meal you can make  20 minutes tops   use the precooked chicken strips and lee kum kee sauce per instructions  steamed rice and brocolli   even the tea is done,formal
wow this is a perfect product to upset michelle obama: it keeps forever  tastes like dessert  and is good for you   might even make you fat  michelle  which is a great american feature ,formal
wow  this mixed bag of candy is pricey on here  i bought at my local walmart for under ten dollars  i am going to give it out to the trick-or-treaters on halloween night ,formal
this is absolutely the best product available if you make your own mayonnaise  however  buying it at the local market means taking out a second mortagage  therefore  buy it online in quantity and save 50% off the local market price ,formal
these were very small and did not hold the same bold flavor as the lollipops do  a little disappointed with the amount and the size per box  next time i will definately order the lollipops,formal
my vet prescribed these vitamins for my dogs   they are doing well and they love the taste   my dogs think they are treats  i wish my own vitamins were this good,formal
my doctor recommended that i drink oolong tea with buckwheat honey twice a day to soothe coughs   this tea is excellent  packaged nicely and reasonably priced   i plan to buy all the tea i use from this vendor ,formal
love the tea  especially if brewed strong and then added to my decaf tea  gives it a good hint of flavor  wish the bags were bigger and better to use for a large container of tea  instead of a cup  good price,formal
our dog gets one per day after he has gone outside to take care of his morning duty  he loves them so much  he starts howling to be let back inside to get his reward ,formal
i am not impressed with this garlic powder  the garlic powder is very powdery and does not seem to have a strong garlic flavor  it is a very strange product indeed   do not recommend ,formal
these are great for on the go     the family grabbed them on the way out and everyone was smiling while munching will order again    note: these are salt and pepper   so expect the flavor,formal
i bought this as a training treat for my little puppy and his siblings  whom i am fostering  and they all love it so for the amount of treats that you get in the bag and for the price  it is a great buy,formal
i believe i have tried all the coffee t-discs for the tassimo   the maxwell french roast hands down is my favorite   i will still try all new products offered but i usually go back the the french roast ,formal
i cannot believe how expensive these are  even at the local grocery store they are only $ 69 per packet  full price   when you add in shipping  you are paying over a dollar a packet  outrageous,formal
i use this everyday in my tea   because it is so sweet  i use less and am therefore getting less calories than i would with regular sugar   it is a delicious substitute   no problems with the shipping either ,formal
we use this in place of and along with pancake syrup and i use in so many recipes   it tastes great and amazon has it at a great price versus what i would pay at my local grocery store,formal
i was rather disappointed  this sounded so wonderful in theory   in practice it was okay   not great  not horrible  just okay  definitely not up to any hype    ,formal
i ordered this gum because my dentist suggested i chew gum with xylitol  the price was great for this gum  it tastes great and i chew it all the time  even my 5 year old son likes it ,formal
since i love chocolate  i was anxious to try this coffee   it smells great but the taste is rather weak  and it certainly does not taste like chocolate   i am not going to buy it again ,formal
this coffee is far better than what one could normally buy at this price point  though not quite the star that some coffees costing three times the price are  it is a very good coffee value ,formal
with 2 chiclets per very small box  this is perfect for the purse  pocket or car  product stays fresher this way and less spillage loss  would make a nice halloween alternative to candy ,formal
this ready-made pie crust is the best  low in fat  no trans fat  and great taste  can use as is or bake for a few minutes to bring out the flavor  wish it were more readily available,formal
great price using amazon is subscription service   the bars are a satisfying snack when i hike or bike even at work   highly recommend but do not let them sit around for they do expire due to chemicals used to preserve,formal
it does indeed remind me of coconut cream pie  tastes decadent but is far better for you than coconut cream pie ;  i have tried all the larabar flavors and this is my favorite  definitely worth a try ,formal
this is my favorite raw bar  i cannot believe the price i see these bars for up to $2 00 per bar  i do automatic shipment on this product and get 15% off plus free shipping  i love them thanks melissa :- ,formal
pros: easy mix 10 cals per pack  cons: taste bitter & fake does not taste like pineapple at all  i gave it a try on 3 different days and it just got worse and worse   yuck,formal
this product came to me and was out of date so i couldnt even use it furthermore i complained about and was told i would be given new product but have not received it as of yet   great customer service huh,formal
my kids go through these at an alarming pace   buying them at the grocery store would break the bank but amazon makes it affordable   use the auto deliver to get it even cheaper ,formal
not very pleased with the performance of this machine: the espresso is very good but it does not come out hot  you have to preheat the cup ahead of time in order to be ok ,formal
my 13-month-old has been eating these for several months  and can not get enough of them the ingredients are good  great for self-feeding  and my baby acts like it is candy  she would eat a can per sitting if i would let her,formal
this is very good blend nice body and hearty flavor definitely worth a try if you have not yet  i still prefer starbucks medium breakfast blend but i will buy this every once in a while for a change of pace ,formal
this is definitely not the original formula that one can buy in the grocery store  one box might not have been too bad but we had to eat through the complete order of multiple boxes we were quite disappointed ,formal
i like the flavor of these--i wish sour cream and onion chex mix was more widely available at stores   however  please note that this is not chex mix   there are only chex in the bag; the bag contains no pretzels or other carbs ,formal
bought this box on sale and they are worth every penny i paid  this was my first time trying these 2 flavors  as stated they are good but i still prefer the spice of the banana walnut :  still rating it five stars for the price,formal
got these in warehouse deals for 50 cents per cookie  a damn good deal and a damn good cookie   given that each cookie is wrapped they last a long time   if cookies are your thing  try these,formal
i recently ordered the breakfast cookies and find them rather unpleasant to eat  perhaps if i were in a situation where that is the only thing i had to eat it would not be quite so bad  i do not know ,formal
even though a bit pricey per cup  i am addicted to my keurig coffee maker   i like variety and this sampler has a great selection   my favorite is are the newman is own and the gm dark magic ,formal
finally a healthy graham cracker that is not filled with salt and or sugar   i like the flavor very much   i put a piece of 70% chocolate on the top and it is a great snack and still rather healthy ,formal
this is a great sampler that came promptly as stated by the vendor  i was disappointed to find out the company is essentially for fund raisers so i am not able to order from them again ,formal
i was a little disapointed as they were a gift  the shipping was not adequate and consequently the case for the chocolates came loose and some of the liqueurs had leaked and were sticky ,formal
i have tried all kinds of k-cups and this is my favorite   it is rather mellow and for myself being a cream sugar guy  i prefer this black and plain due to the smooth taste ,formal
paid only $22 with free shipping for 96 teenies compared to about $35 at the pet store  how can you go wrong with a deal like that  the dog begs for his daily greenie  got to have them ,formal
our three dogs are addicted to greenies  even at one treat per day it has become an expensive habit but one we are willing to promote   we were thrilled to find such a great price and free shipping,formal
i was quite disappointed with the rice veggie bowl mix  very dull  rather tasteless   i do not know that i will use up the remaining 11 dishes   i may donate them to a food kitchen  d  heliotis,formal
so  i think it tastes ok  it is nothing special and certainly not worth all the rave reviews  i also think the pasta leaves an excessive amount of residue when straining   nonetheless  it is gluten free and organic ,formal
this cacao powder is so good  it makes the best brownies  hot chocolate  no-bake cookies  etc   and it is a reasonable price compared with the $1 05 per ounce i was paying for organic cocoa powder at our local health food store ,formal
we think these taste great   our child loves them  we take them with us for a healthier on-the-go snack   they are not as sugary as other brands and therefore not quite as sticky on little fingers ,formal
the coffee is pretty good at the smallest cup size  but it gets weak fast the larger serving size you use  for a brand claiming to be black  i expected more coffee per cup ,formal
my pup loves this food and i love that it is organic and not bulked up with useless  unhealthy fillers  however  unless you are using the  isubscribe & save feature  you are better off buying this at walmart for $2 18 per can ,formal
a light blush table wine  this kit was a hit with friends and family this christmas  two and a half cups of cane sugar were added prior to bottling  alcohol content was approximately 12%  flavor best when served very lightly chilled ,formal
my kid loves this one  he generally eats most of the veggie and fruit packages  but this one serves as a desert  pouch is rather small for the price  smoothie consistency  not too liquid  nice berry  not overly sweet taste,formal
we love air popped corn and this product was really great  there was more kernels popped per bowl than normally popped with orville is yellow corn which is all i could find at the store  yummy nutty flavor that needs little if any additions ,formal
kids and adults loved these   its a fun game to do with your kids  which one will you get  juicy pear or booger   which by the way the kids said this was the grossest one    they loved the experiment ,formal
i find the grade b better for pancakes   i bought a before and rather tasteless   i will buy again   i sent at christmas time with the pancake mix and it was a treat for my far away friend and practical ,formal
we use a lot of organic maple syrup and this was a brand recommended and amazon subscribe and save had the best per ounce price  i love not having to think about stocking up on items i buy all the time,formal
great price and quick delivery   however  the package was  poorly packed   the box was crushed and the package was split open  therefore compromising the freshness of the product ,formal
these were just not good cookies  they were dry and bland and certainly not worth the calories  they are high in fiber but they are not a healthy cookie  per se  there just was nothing to recommend these cookies ,formal
i liked this coffee so well that i ordered it again  the only thing disappointing to me was that the first order was packed in 2-25 pack tully boxes whereas the second order was just all thrown together in a cardboard mailing box ,formal
i absolutely love this coffee  have been buying it for years   so great to have a single pot packet on those bleary mornings  plus  $1 30 per 8 cup pot of coffee is not bad ,formal
a great snack  my toddler loves this stuff   i believe a prior reviewer is confused about a recall   that was for a completely different robert is product and had nothing to do with this one ,formal
i love buying gum this way - but 1 3 the cost at my local wholesale club works out to less than 1 2 the cost of buying at the store individually  around $0 65 per pack ,formal
we have 4 dogs  one had terrible plaque build-up  it is not gone after 2 months of using this product but is remarkably better  the dogs love the treats  we buy them 8 bags at a time so we will not run out ,formal
best one if you are looking for pure st john wort tea  all the other st john tea have other items in them hence you effects like high blood pressure get this instead it is better then a regular anti depressant and works right away,formal
if i can not find this at my local market or in a near by store  i order it from amazon  i drink this tea after a night of drinking alcohol in order to help cleanse my liver ,formal
i had ordered this online as i use this product a lot  i only got 3 tins not the 4tins as per the order  the packaging was ripped  i will never order from you again,formal
these were recommended by our vet since chester does not handle wheat products well and therefore cannot have greenies   his teeth were becoming a mess  so the vet recommended this product   he loves them  and it is made a noticeable difference ,formal
item was a good deal   the caribou blend coffee is a nice blend  not too strong  the price was good for the 24 count box  less than  80 per cup   i will purchase again ,formal
tastes great  but has msg and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil   it is my fault for forgetting to check ingredients before ordering--but seriously  it should be unthinkable and illegal to use such chemicals in our food ,formal
the product was cheap  so i bought a pack to try  was not the greatest beef jerky but not the worst for massed produced jerky  beef jerky is cut too thick for my liking  flavor was not really sweet or spicy ,formal
upon receiving this product after my son had consumed some it was discovered that the bag was full of green mold  i would not even give it one star but i had to if i wanted to be able to post this ,formal
i drink this 2 or 3 times per day after my once in the morning regular coffee; it does not taste like decaf  it is not waterdown and does not have the artificial taste that some decaf has; also smells great,formal
everybody that i sent these to in the past few years  about 40 people per year  has loved this chocolate   they say it is rich and very gourmet   superior to sees  ghirardelli  godiva  etc ,formal
the vita coco acai & pomegranate is the best tasting of all the flavors  it is light and tasty  the right balance between coconut water and fruit juice  i wish the 17 ounce boxes were still available ,formal
these cookies taste great  but if you are health conscious  these cookies are  not for you  i believe two cookies added up to about 150-200 calories with some trans fat  great taste but unhealthy choice ,formal
bulk paprika is a black cloud looming above the food industry ready to storm all over the spice section of your local grocers   i suggest you take cover immediately  or least invest in a sturdy poncho ,formal
please note that there is an intial fishy smell i can only compare to tuna when draining  drain and rinse very well  saute in coconut oil or olive oil until the excess water evaporates  serve with your favorite asian or italian sauce ,formal
about the only time i eat something like this is when i have not allowed enough time for a proper breakfast before dashing out the door  these bars are tasty and filling without being overly sweet as some such products are  yummy ,formal
i try to eat two of these per day  they are great for adding fiber to your diet and i really enjoy the taste   i have only tried the strawberry flavor   i subscribed to this item via amazon prime ,formal
the flavor of the salt is very nice  purchased it upon reading about it is many health benefits  the price is very reasonable as well  in local health food store it costs twice as much ,formal
i totally agree with all of the other 1 star reviewers here   this used to be my favorite bar  but now it has almost no flavor and indeed does have a waxy texture ,formal
i have tried many decaf green teas  both organic and conventional and this is the only one i like or consider worth buying   i have been buying it for a few years now  wish it were easier to find in the stores ,formal
i like the taste  and the fact that it is organic  but the first bottle i am using clumps very badly  i get a couple of shakes and then have to bang the bottle on something to loosen it up again  rather frustrating ,formal
all of my cats adore these treats  one cat in particular nags me constantly to feed him some and if i do not give him enough  he jumps up beside me and pokes me repeatedly with one claw  great price  too,formal
this trap is by far the worst gopher trap i have ever purchased  the trap does not engage  in order for me to get my credit  i would lose more headaches than anythig else  save your money ,formal
i found them pretty tasty and if i do not chew them but just let chocolate melt  i can make 3-4 of them last 5 minutes  therefore eat 10-12 total instead of 1 2 of a can ,formal
this powder mixes easily in ice water to make a delicious peach flavored iced tea  i bought it from amozon because my local grocer no longer carried it  the price on line is $1 cheaper per bottle ,formal
as stated in the title  this powder was exactly what i was looking for  it has the same flavor as the green tea latte sold at starbuck is and it is good for your health too,formal
the coffee is great  of couse   by having the coffee delivered on a regular basis i have saved $1 53 per can over grocery store pricing   and  i will not run out of coffee   that is a good thing,formal
yuck this product contains 170 calories per serving as opposed to 110 for regular instant oatmeal  i could live with that  but this product is actually inedible  i tried one packet and could not finish it  the rest were given to a shelter ,formal
i split this bar with my wife   she  as it seems most women are  is the expert on chocolate   nonetheless  both she and i really like the taste of the bar and will be ordering more ,formal
i am not a big fan of dark chocolates  milk chocolates for the win   but these tasted surprisingly milky  for the price amazon is selling them though  i would definitely suggest you to stick to your convenient stores hershey bars ,formal
my husband and i found these in rome and malta on our honeymoon  and i feel in love with them   they are the best pringles  i wish these were sold in the us,formal
very healthy and filling  low in calories and sodium and very tasty too  a surprisingly good product  it is too bad that the brand does not have more products with nutritional information posted for i would likely buy more of them ,formal
the french vanilla flavor and aroma is too pungent when used alone  in order to reduce the intense flavor  i recommend using only one french vanilla pod and one pod of an unflavored coffee  either decaf or otherwise ,formal
these make a great and tasty treat and only 50 calories in 3 popsicles  the cost here is much too high   we purchase them at local supermarkets for 0 75 to $1 per box of 10 ,formal
a very nice olive oil  served me well in my cooking  it has a rather light flavor which i quite prefer  it also came packaged very well to avoid any mishaps during shipping ,formal
this is so similar to the latte creamer i believe they are nearly one in the same  it has an after taste of sour milk  i discontinued use and threw most of it away ,formal
we would bought them because they were in washington state  but they are dried hotter and are therefore crisper than other apple rings  and they have lots of core bits which are very hard,formal
this stevia valencia orange is great   i put a few drops in my water bottle as i hate to drink water and it really lightens up the taste and therefore i drink more water   like the lemon stevia drops also ,formal
these puffs are great to have around when you crave a crunchy  cheezy  salty snack that is not too bad for you  only 140 calories per bag compared to about 230 calories for similar sized cheetos puffs ,formal
this tea is magnificent  it is loose leave tea and you only need a small teaspoon per cup so there is plenty to go around  it smells heavenly  i wish i could get a potpourri version for my house ,formal
the picture and size of this product leads you to believe that you will expect more mushrooms  when drained  there is maybe a cup of mushrooms per can  other than that  they appear to be ok  better buy would be sliced mushrooms ,formal
this is a great tasting product that also came in a very appreciated packagin  i do thank you guys  i will order more when i am running out  no biggie  you all hae a good day  later   g ,formal
i purchased these pistachios as a present for my husband   he loves turkish pistachios and we can not get them here in rural maine  these nuts are fresh and exactly what he wanted  the price per pound works out the best i could find ,formal
seller talks about growing kefir is like art  but the kefir that i got from him was flat  after readind on dom is kefir site i believe the grain was squeezed by the seller ouch ,formal
i am no bimbo but i do not want my teeth to fall out i got visit dentist almost twice a year and its not exactly enriching to see item without sugar content and fat content and calories per serving is this a fake product,formal
perfect for a classic frappe enjoy  make sure you purchase the coffee packed in greece  as others are different and will alter the taste of a classic greek iced frappe or hot ness ,formal
i love the size of these cans because one can easily decants into my glass bottle for daily use   the remaining can stores the oil better than if it were in a bottle so it works out nicely   i recommend it,formal

fast delivery and good pricing for cost  only wish they were even less expensive as a product   interestingly  it is a cardboard box they come in   always thought it was plastic    : ,formal

this is a good size medicine box for my mothers she has to take so many tablets each time each compartment is big enough i would suggest the producer to use different color of plastic for each day this will help avoid mix-up,formal
these are adorable letters but do not miss that they are only a couple inches in size i returned them because they sent his first letter w o the other two but nonetheless wanted letters that were the typical size you see in stores about 6 inches,formal
pretty small for wall above full sized crib - and hangers are not centered so one needs double stick tape to get the animal to stand on their feet rather than their head - cute though and the price is right,formal
i purchased another brand and they lasted only about a year i bought these 2 years ago and not one has failed i also notice no reduction in holding of a charge these are definitely working as advertised,formal

we are used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy   doubt very much habanero is used at all   could take it up a notch or two ,direct
okay  i should not eat potato chips  nor should anyone  but these are so spicy  i would find it hard to eat very many  that makes them an indulgence that rescues some people from overindulgence ,direct
these chips taste awesome  and unlike most other flavored chips  they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip  just do not pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption  they will totally know it was you ,direct
these where great couldnt stop eating them  lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time  cant say enough about these  they where shipped faster than what i paid to have shipped also  thank you so much ,direct

good alternative to coconut oil when oiling your hair   i usually use coconut oil but will occasionally use this oil for my very long hair   it moisturizes well and washes out easily ,direct

have used this seasoning for years  plus many others tones products   adds great flavor to almost any food  especially fish and seafood   glad to find it on amazon as costco does not carry tones  only sam is does ,direct
comes out soft and not hard as other brown rice products   can be used as sushi rice   it is rice that may be difficult to find  so we are buying through here   wonderful,direct
dogs love this treat  a great treat for a dog because they are lean   we break the soft treats into about 6 pieces to give our dog  so  she gets several treats for one ~ otherwise  she would swallow it whole ,direct
much much better than red bull or anything like that  you are awake and *alert* versus just having your heart pumping faster  due to influx of caffeine  and still being drowsy in your mind  nothing bad to say about it ,direct

nothing disposable is allowed when it comes to the american flag   having a disposable wrapper trashes my beloved nation is flag   this most certainly can not be an american owned business   i am surprised amazon allowed it ,direct
one of those three inferior brands i referred to in another review   never tried eight oclock before  should not have done it that time around   taste was awful  like maybe bags had gotten lost in warehouse for a few years ,direct
my sister in law sent these while she was in germany   my daughter only wants this candy   she did not even eat her halloween candy this year  just these  i am so grateful that we can purchase them online ,direct

very flavor of this canned expresso  better than the starbucks one  thus  the calories should be only 50 instead of 100 in this product description  i will say great item for expresso lover,direct
i had this shipped to my home while i was on vacation so i did not see it when it arrived   when i got it it was broken in many pieces and unusable   i will never do business with this company again ,direct
brewing directions are right on tin so do not know what the negative review is about  excellent for everyday green tea  when brewed properly  170  it is never bitter  lovely aroma  i am on my 3rd order ,direct
my 3-year old has been eating this soup since she was about 1 year old   she absolutely loves it  and so do i  it is organic and very healthy  with lower sodium than just about any other canned soup on the market  ,direct
this green tea is very different to all those that i have had before  it has a very delicate mix of green tea with a most delightful undertone of citrus flavor making it currently my favorite green tea ,direct
these cashews have a definite kick to them  they are spicy and would be perfect with an ice cold beer on a hot summer day  the container keeps them fresh  these nuts are highly recommended ,direct
they took a great nut-and ruined it by putting too much salt & pepper on it   usually one nut leads to another -- for those on a diet  try this nut  it will curb your desire for seconds ,direct
i have no idea how or why anyone would like this its disgusting  tastes like wet cardboard  ive tried a lot of gluten free mac n cheese this is the worst ive been gf for a while worst thing ever tasted,direct
for whatever reason  my puppy is not interested in these treats   i thought they would be perfect for training based on their size  but my beagle mix wants nothing to do with them ,direct
i bought these for training my cavalier king charles spaniel puppy - she goes nuts over these things  the peanut butter flavor too  she will do just about anything to get some of these treats ,direct
my foie gras arrived quickly and fully frozen  i was able to easily separate it into two pieces to save one lobe for later  there was only the one connecting vein in the middle so prep was minimal ,direct
it was great  good taste  i found another website that has more flavors emailed them and they were even better  try it for your self  look up milk in the mail dot com  all one word  there is alot more flavors there ,direct
beware   the photo of plant on order page shows large white flowers  there were no flowers on the two plants that were shipped from amazon   this is unsatisfactory  particularly for an expensive plant ,direct
great stuff can use for cooking and also for mixed drinks  best in margaritas i was very surprised at how quickly it was shipped  the next time i need them  i will be back,direct

how many calories  how much fat trans fat  how much protein  full ingredients should be listed - they sound great but nutritional info should be supplied   too much of a puzzle to order without knowing      petunia,direct
wow  i cannot believe that so much  good healthy stuff could be in such  a small package the calorie count   etc  would help others choose this  unique food bar ,direct
i had very dry  flaky and irritated facial skin  even in humid weather  and tried this on an outside chance it would help;  it did more than that and now  with a thin application every other day i have no more problems ,direct
this candy is not about taste  instead the experience young children can have with it  what young girl would not be into this gem it is one sweet ring  from someone quite special  sure to get at least one i do ,direct
i have two kids that have celiac disease  they absolutely love these bars  they are becoming difficult to find now  i think they are a great breakfast bar  snack whatever easy to take along with you when on the go also,direct
my dog really likes these treats  i have not used them long enough to evaluate if they are helping her bad breath but i feel that since they are made from natural ingredients and my dog enjoys them what harm can it do ,direct
do not understand why that people are happy with the price here  please check other stores or online shops  you can just easily find much cheaper price than this  even more than 10 dollars difference as compare to sam is club ,direct
these things are perfect for a mid-run refuel  after about 2 hrs i want something more substantial than the honey gels and these are perfect  the right amount of sweetness without being overwhelming  i never go on long runs or hikes without one ,direct
i get tired of only consuming gels on long runs and these honey stingers are a delicious alternative that deliver about the same amount of energy  even without the caffeine  while also being easy on the stomach ,direct
i bought these chocolate covered blueberries for my dad for a father is day gift  he said there was only one thing wrong with them-- he could not stop easting them  they were delicious ,direct
this product tastes like a mild  nutty honey---very different--it would be great on toast  biscuits  pancakes  french toast  or to use in baking  has a delicate  vanilla-like aroma  quite addictive,direct
i love this product  there are many things you can make as low-carb replacements  my advice would be to order it direct  why would anyone pay that much for something you can get for less that $4 00 directly from carbalose ,direct
they are a great product and automated delivery at great prices can not be beat  my dogs go crazy when it comes to greenie time at night   no matter how many nights we do the same thing they are always over the top for greenies,direct
after doing an extensive price comparison we ended up purchasing a double pack from amazon  so pleased with the greenies product took one of our dogs for his annual exam yesterday and the doctor mentioned twice how good our boy is teeth look yay,direct
my dogs love these  they start drooling everytime they get these  not really sure if they do anything for their teeth breath  gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars just because these are alittle pricey considering they are gone in like 30 seconds ,direct
there is contradicting information   the description says senior greenie large  while the photo shows regular as well as 27 treats versus 27 ounce   anyone that reviews and can clarify the actual product would be much appreciated ,direct
this is really good   you would not know it was gluten free if no one told you   my friend has a gluten free kitchen  so i eat what she has but this product i even buy for myself ,direct
the hot chocolate is really delicious i use two spoons with 2% milk and a couple of spoons of sugar natural sweetener - tastes great i drink two mugs every day  service was really great  ordered on sunday  delivered on monday no complaints ,direct
amazon: we want no fear back do not ever stop selling it they say out of stock  could that mean the end of no fear from amazon everybody get together to get it back on amazon,direct
i discovered deboles pasta years ago when only available in health food stores   delicious  my friend says this is the only pasta that her diabetic daughter can eat without a sugar spike ,direct
these were priced well and were very good  however if i wanted mini pecan pies again i would buy the moon pie brand here on amazon  they look almost identical  but i think they taste better ,direct
these are great little snacks  tender and yummy will definitely buy them again  great cranberry flavor  but they do contain a little sugar  so if you are very carb restricted  you might want the ones with no fruit ,direct
my dog is 14 years old with many health problems  he is fussy about his food  but this is one that he will consistently eat  the whole newman line is known for giving back to society  so i feel good about that as well ,direct
i ordered this item as a set of two black food writer pens     when my order arrived it only contained one pen   please double check your orders before shipment ,direct
these have been a childhood favorite  had them every summer visiting family in wales  miss them in the us love them & can not get them anywhere here except specialty shops; which are not in hawaii,direct
could not find colors besides black  white and red so was please to find these online at a good price  used for my daughters minnie party  and had plenty leftover for other baked goods events too  very cute,direct

i had a super hard time finding anyone who had these chewies in stock  you had alot in stock and shipped them out asap  thanks   will definitely purchase from you again ,direct
wish that this brand was more widely available in stores and amazon ca  great if you are not able to get enough fresh ingredients to make your own pesto  no metallic taste which you might expect from a metal tube ,direct
this is a nice puzzle  you have three games in one  so your dog doesnt get to bored with one type  the only thing about this one is the plastic seems thin so i shall see how long it lasts without breaking ,direct
nothing to say about the cookies      but there was no expiry date on the boxes the boxes look like they have been in the warehouse for years  i have no idea how old they are  very disappointed,direct
we go through cereal pretty quickly so ordering several boxes at a time works well for us  the price from amazon is lower than that in stores  no reason to buy from brick-and-mortar any more,direct
this product unlike baking powders you buy at your local grocery store contains no aluminum compounds which experts say you should stay away from   it is a good product that works well and the price is right ,direct
these are so great  the only calories you get is what you add to them  they dont have anything bad to them  they taste like whatever you put in them  they help you lose weight also ,direct
received mine several weeks ago without any dents  tasty product  would be nice to know why some people are getting dented cans as it was double boxed and can not see how they could all be dented ,direct
watch out it has msg   can not figure out why these companies insist on putting msg in otherwise good ingredients   do not think msg is good for any one and some people are highly allergic to it ,direct

a weekend or week long fast using only rice & green tea works wonders for one is energy level   this rice is very tasty even with just a bit of salt  which makes the week much more pleasant,direct
these chips are really good   will definitely take the place of regular potato chips without feeling like you gave anything up   i purchased them locally for $2 50 though so this price is high ,direct

great mints  not too strong with rich dark chocolate  unfortunately  they are overpriced by 400% here  that is right - they are only $1 39 in the supermarket  which leads me to believe their other products are also overpriced here  no sale ,direct

great idea  my black lab enjoys getting her pills now  she actually waits for the loaded pill pocket before she digs into her supper bowl  cost is considerably less than buying them at a local store ,direct
nice that it has all natural ingredients  however   beet juice seems to be very sweet  also  as mentioned before  it sticky  lets say it is unique  not  in a bad unique way ,direct
these ribs splinter terribly into small sharp pieces   took them away from my dog as i do not want to risk an intestinal perforation from these   very disappointed in these   i will stick to bully sticks from bravo instead ,direct
my order was cancelled 4 days after placing it  i received no explanation or advanced notice  i will think twice before purchasing from godiva again  which i previously did a lot over the holidays ,direct
